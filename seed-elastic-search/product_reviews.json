The convenience factor is huge - I can see and speak to whoever is at my door in real-time right from my phone! The video quality is clear and reliable, making it easier to identify people or packages. The security aspect is wonderful too. I feel a lot safer knowing I can monitor my front door at all times. However, it's not without its flaws. The installation was a bit tricky and it sometimes takes a moment for alerts to come through. Also, I've noticed a few minor glitches in the system, but nothing major. For $249.99, it's a little pricey, but for the peace of mind and convenience it provides, I'd say it's worth the investment."

    "reviewText": "I had high hopes for the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, especially given its price tag. Unfortunately, I've been experiencing quite a few issues with it. The worst problem has been a poor, unstable connection. Even when I am at home with strong WiFi, I'm often not able to view the live feed properly. Also, the alerts come in very late, making the real-time feature almost useless. I've had moments where I only received the alert after the person at the door had already left. As if these technical glitches weren't enough, I also have privacy concerns as the doorbell seems to record even when it's not supposed to. On the positive side, when the video does come through, it is clear and sharp. However, overall, I'm quite disappointed."

The real-time alerts are reliable and prompt, which is great when I'm away from home. I love how I can see and speak to anyone at my door through clear, high-definition video, all from my smartphone. There was one instance where a package was delivered while I was out, and I was able to instruct the delivery guy on where to safely leave it - all in real-time! However, the installation was a bit tricky, and it can be a bit pricy for some. But considering the peace of mind it brings, it's definitely a worthy investment. I'd give this smart doorbell a solid 5 stars."

I can now answer the door from my couch or even when I'm not home. The real-time video feed is clear and reliable, even during the night. In terms of security, it's a game-changer. I have caught several porch pirates red-handed thanks to the swift alerts on my phone. The setup was a breeze and I've had no issues with connection or glitches. Privacy could be a concern for some, but as long as you set up your motion zones properly, it won't pick up unnecessary movement. For $249.99, it's an investment in peace of mind and security. Highly recommended!"

The real-time alerts and video clarity are top-notch, making it super convenient to monitor my front door from my phone. I've never felt more secure, knowing I can clearly see who's at my door without even being home. The connectivity has been reliable, I've had no issues even with my sometimes spotty WiFi. However, the reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the installation was a bit tricky- the instructions could've been clearer. Plus, the price is a bit steep at $229.00.

It's incredibly convenient - I can check who's at my door from anywhere using the app. The real-time alerts are super reliable, I get a notification the minute someone is at my door. The video quality is crystal clear, even at night, which really adds to the security aspect. I had a situation where a package got delivered while I was out of town, and I could clearly see and speak to the courier, instructing him where to leave the parcel. But my favorite feature has to be the face recognition, it can even differentiate between family members! It’s a bit pricey but worth every penny. The only downside is the installation process, as it requires a wired connection which might be tricky for some. Overall, it's a fantastic piece of kit and I highly recommend it."

The convenience of answering the door from my phone is fantastic and the real-time alerts are very reliable. I can see who's at the door in clear 1080p video whether I'm at home or away, which gives me great peace of mind. Its security features are second to none, as it continuously records video 24/7 so I never miss anything. There have been one or two slight glitches, but these were quickly resolved by resetting the device. And the $229.00 price tag? Totally worth it for this level of convenience and security. Highly recommend the Nest Hello to anyone in need of a smart doorbell!"

Half the time, the alerts are so slow that by the time I get them, the person at the door is long gone. The other half, the doorbell is just flat-out glitchy and loses connection. It's also led to privacy concerns as it randomly records at times when nobody is at the door. I've reached out to customer service and unfortunately, my issues still persist. For $199.99, I expected a lot more. I can't recommend this product."

The delay in getting notifications is an inconvenience, especially when I'm expecting an important delivery or a visitor. It also often suffers from poor connection, which is surprising given my robust home WiFi network. As for the video quality, it's decent when the connection is stable, but this is rare. Lastly, the privacy concerns are real. I always feel a bit uncomfortable knowing that my data could potentially be misused.

I'll be exploring other options in the future."

The video clarity is pretty solid, so you can see who's at your door, even in less than perfect lighting, which is a big plus. However, I've had some significant issues with slow alerts and a glitchy interface. There've been several times where the app alerted me to someone at my door several minutes after they'd already left. In terms of connection, it's been quite hit and miss. Some days it works perfectly, other days it barely connects at all. And while I appreciate the convenience and security aspects, I've got some serious privacy concerns after reading about potential vulnerabilities. In conclusion, it's ok, but for $199.99, I'd expect a more reliable performance."

The only minor drawback is the battery does seem to drain a little faster than I'd like, but it's a small price to pay for the peace of mind and convenience. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock."

    "reviewText": "Title: Great Features, Yet Disappointing Performance \n\nI bought the Schlage Encode mainly for the convenience and security of a smart lock. The remote access is a fantastic feature, allowing me to unlock my door from anywhere using the app. Also, the installation was a breeze, and I had it working in about 30 minutes. \n\nHowever, I've been consistently disappointed by its reliability. The lock jams occasionally and requires physical intervention, making the smart features almost moot in those moments. The app has also been wonky, not always recognizing the lock. And boy, does this thing chew through batteries! I've had to replace them almost monthly. \n\nWhile the Schlage Encode has amazing features on paper, it falls short in real-world use. For the price, I expected more reliability and less ongoing maintenance."

The convenience factor is huge - I love that I can grant remote access to guests and service providers without having to physically be there. The install was surprisingly easy too, only took me about 30 minutes.\n\nBut the secure aspect is what I love most. I feel safe knowing that this lock has built-in alarm technology and high-grade encryption. That said, it's not perfect. The app occasionally has issues and the battery life isn't as good as I'd hoped. But overall, this is a solid product that adds a lot of convenience and security.

The concept is fantastic - remote access and convenience all in one, but the execution falls flat. The primary issue is the battery drain, it's just too frequent. I've had to replace batteries every two weeks! Besides, the accompanying app is riddled with issues. I'm often unable to access the lock remotely, making the whole point of a smart lock moot. The reliability is questionable too, it has jammed on me a couple of times, leaving me locked out.

The security level is incredibly reassuring - not only does it have an automatic lock feature, but it also allows for remote access, meaning we can keep an eye on our home even while we're away.

I'm not sure if it's a product defect or a design flaw, but it's inconvenient having to constantly replace batteries. Secondly, the app is buggy and unreliable. There are times when I can't even access the lock remotely, which defeats the purpose of a smart lock. Lastly, the lock jams frequently. I've had to manually unlock it more times than I care to admit. I was looking for convenience and security, but this product has been more of a hassle. The only redeeming qualities are the easy installation process and sleek design. However, those don’t make up for the lack of reliability. Not a purchase I'd recommend."

But, the user-friendly interface and its overall performance make it a worthy purchase."

Despite its small size, the sound quality is excellent, clear and crisp, just like I'm in a studio. I love that it's versatile in responding to my diverse commands from playing my favorite tunes to informing me about the weather. \n\nThe user-friendly feature is a real highlight too.

It's incredibly responsive, sometimes it feels like having a conversation with a person rather than a device.\n\nHowever, the device does have some connectivity issues, like sometimes it doesn't pick up my phone immediately. Also, it's only compatible with Apple devices, which can be limiting. But as an Apple user, it fits perfectly into my ecosystem.

I was really hoping for better privacy settings, but I find myself constantly worried about the lack of control. The limited command range is also a huge downside, it simply can't do as much as other smart speakers. For the price, I expected it to take more than just basic commands.

The installation was a breeze and integrating it with my existing smart home system was absolutely hassle-free. I truly appreciate the wide spectrum of colors and levels of brightness it offers. Perfect for setting the mood during movie nights or for hosting dramatic dinner parties. It's also energy-efficient, which is a huge plus for me. However, the app interface could be a little more user-friendly, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a big issue. For the price point of $79.99, I believe it's totally worth it. Highly recommended for those in need of smart lighting solutions!"

I love the customization options and the fact that you can create any shape you like, it's a real conversation starter when guests are over. Syncing it with music makes for a fantastic party atmosphere! The app is easy to use and installation was a breeze. My only gripe? The price. At $199.99, it's a bit steep for lightings, but considering the fun and versatility it brings, I reckon it’s worth the splurge. All in all, a solid 4-star product for anyone looking to add a touch of modernity and colour to their home."

The ability to control the color and brightness from my phone is definitely a plus. The problem though, is that they don't always respond to the app which can be frustrating. Also, the price point is quite high, especially for a lighting solution. The adhesive strips included also don't hold up too well over time and I've had to re-stick a few panels. Overall, they're a nice aesthetic addition but for $199.99, I would expect a little more reliability."

I love the geometric design and how you can arrange them in any pattern you desire. The app is very user-friendly and allows you to customize light patterns and colors to fit your mood or even sync with your favorite music.

    "reviewText": "I really wanted to love these Nanoleaf Shapes, but they've been more frustrating than fun. Sure, the concept is cool - customizable light panels that can be formed into any design you like. The problem starts with the installation. The adhesive strips provided are weak, and my design kept falling off the wall. Then there's the app. It's glitchy and often doesn't respond to commands. Sometimes, the lights would randomly change colors or not turn off at all. Not to mention the price tag of $199.99, it's a steep price for a product that doesn't deliver as promised. The concept is great and when it works, it's genuinely impressive. But between the reliability issues and the price, I can't recommend these lights."

The Yeelight app is pretty handy, allowing me to adjust the bulb's brightness and color from my phone. I've set it to gradually increase the light intensity in the morning, mimicking a sunrise to help me wake up naturally - a feature my previous smart bulb did not have. Voice control with Alexa is also a big plus. The bulb is on the pricier side, but with the energy savings and longevity of LED, it's definitely a worthwhile investment. All in all, this bulb adds convenience to my life and a fun pop of color when I need it. It's a solid 5-star product!"

If I turned off the light from the wall switch, it often reset itself and lost my custom settings. Additionally, I found it to be quite sluggish in terms of response times. \n\nTo top it off, the price is steep at $29.99. You can find other smart bulbs with better functionality for a similar price. It's a good concept, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I really wanted to love this bulb, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend it."

Once I finally managed to get it running, I encountered temperature inaccuracies, with the thermostat often reading a few degrees higher than the actual room temperature. This not only affected my comfort but also had me constantly adjusting settings. To top it off, the companion app had numerous bugs and kept crashing on my smartphone. Even the Wi-Fi connectivity was dodgy at best. I expected so much more for the price I paid. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this product."

My electricity bills have noticeably reduced since I've started using it. The remote control feature is a dream - adjusting the temperature from my phone while I'm snuggled up in bed is just awesome. Setup was a breeze too, quite intuitive and user-friendly. However, it's not all perfect. I've had a couple of issues with the app - it has stalled on me a few times. And once, I had to reconnect the thermostat to my Wi-Fi. But overall, it’s been a great buy and I think it's worth the price. If you're looking to make your home smarter and more efficient, this is a good place to start."

I love how I can remotely control it from my phone - makes it super easy to adjust the temperature without getting up from my couch. Handy when the weather's being unpredictable! \n\nThe setup was slightly challenging, I admit, but once you get past it, the thermostat works like a charm. It's user-friendly, and despite a few app bugs I noticed initially, updates have since rectified these minor hiccups. \n\nOverall, the Sengled Smart Thermostat has added a level of comfort and efficiency to my home. Although there's some room for improvement, I think it's a solid investment for $129.99."

I initially bought it for its energy-saving feature and I must say, it does a great job. My energy bills have significantly reduced since its installation.

This thermostat is simple to use, with an intuitive interface that even my technophobic aunt could navigate. I've seen a noticeable drop in my energy bills thanks to its efficient programming. Best part? I can control the thermostat remotely using my phone, even when I'm not home. This helps me to ensure my house is at the perfect temperature when I return, without wasting energy all day. As with any gadget, it took me a bit to get it set up initially. But, once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing. Overall, this is an efficient, energy-saving device that I'd recommend to anyone wanting to make their home smarter. It's been worth every penny of the $129.99 I paid for it!"

Initially, I was excited to automate my home appliances, but this plug made it more of a chore. Firstly, setting up the plug with my phone was a nightmare. The app crashed multiple times and took forever to sync.\n\nWhen it finally did work, the plug was inconsistent. It would randomly turn off my lamp through the night, not something you'd expect from a $24.99 device. The energy monitoring feature, however, is a neat feature with potential but again, unreliable data tainted the experience.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for a reliable plug to automate your home, this isn't it. There are better, more reliable smart plugs out there. This one needs some serious re-engineering."

I love the idea of controlling my home appliances remotely, which is why I ordered it, but the setup process was so complicated and frustrating. I followed the instructions step by step, but still wasn't able to connect it to my Wi-Fi network after several attempts.\n\nWhen it did connect, the connection was unstable and the lag time was quite noticeable. I was hoping to use it for my floor lamp and coffee maker, but the plug kept disconnecting randomly, leaving me in the dark or without my morning brew. Also, it didn't integrate well with my Google Home speaker, another major letdown.\n\nOn the positive side, the design is sleek and compact, it doesn't block the second outlet which is nice. But unfortunately, the connectivity issues outweigh the positives. For $24.99, I expected a better quality product."

On paper, it seemed perfect: easy to install, customizable colors, and controllable via smartphone. However, in reality, the installation was a nightmare with the adhesive not sticking properly. And even when it did stick, after a few days, parts of it would just fall off the wall. To top it off, the color consistency was subpar. Some parts would be a rich blue while others would be a faded light blue despite setting the same color. The only positive point was the app, fairly intuitive and easy to use.

While the device does sync to my phone quickly, the temperature readings are consistently off. I have even compared them with a traditional thermometer and found discrepancies of 2-3 degrees. This is a big issue, especially during flu season when a degree can mean the difference between a mild fever and a high one. For a $49.99 thermometer, I expected far better accuracy. The only redeeming feature is its durable build, but what's the use if it can't perform its primary function? Can't recommend it, sadly."

    "reviewText": "I purchased the Smart Video Doorbell Chime with high hopes, but unfortunately, it's been anything but smart. Initially, it was tricky to install with poor instructions. After setup, I found the video quality to be equally disappointing - grainy and pixelated, especially in low light. The motion detection feature was overly sensitive and kept alerting me to cars passing by, which was quite annoying. The lag between the doorbell ringing and the chime sounding was also significant, leading to missed deliveries. On top of it all, it stopped functioning in cold weather. It's a shame because the concept is great, but the execution is poor. For $49.99, I expected a lot more. Regrettably, I can't recommend this product."

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Smart Video Doorbell Chime and I am thoroughly impressed. The setup was a breeze and it quickly integrated with my existing smart home system. The video quality is crystal clear, even at night, and the addition of the chime ensures I never miss a visitor, thanks to its audible alert. The doorbell's motion detection feature is a game-changer, providing peace of mind when I'm not at home. Despite all these great features, the price is astonishingly affordable at $49.99. The only downside might be that the chime could be a bit louder for larger homes, but it's perfect for my apartment. This is a stellar product that's worth every penny. Highly recommended!"

    "reviewText": "I recently installed this Smart Video Doorbell Chime and I must say, it's a little gem for the price ($49.99). The video quality is quite impressive, even in low light conditions, and the sound quality of the chime is clear and loud enough. It even allows me to answer the door from my smartphone which is super convenient when I'm not at home. \n\nHowever, it does have its downsides. The installation process was a bit tricky and the instructions weren't as clear as they could've been, plus the app can be a bit glitchy at times. Despite these shortcomings, I found it to be a worthwhile addition to my home security system. For its price, it offers excellent value and peace of mind."

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased this Smart Video Doorbell Chime and it's been a game changer for our home security. The installation was straightforward and the user interface on the app is intuitive. I love how I can see who's at the door directly from my phone, even when I'm not at home. The video quality is surprisingly good, both during the day and at night. I also appreciate the chime's volume control feature - it's loud enough to hear from anywhere in my house but not so loud as to be intrusive. One slight drawback is the motion sensor can be a little too sensitive, triggering alerts for passing cars. However, this minor issue hardly impacts my overall satisfaction with this product. For the price, this doorbell chime's features and performance are beyond impressive. I highly recommend it."

    "reviewText": "I'm absolutely thrilled with my new Smart Video Doorbell Chime. For only $49.99, it's a total game-changer! It was super easy to install; I had it up and running in less than 30 minutes. The video quality is top-notch and the live stream feature is incredibly convenient when I'm away from home. I can even communicate with visitors through the two-way audio feature, which I find extremely handy. My only slight gripe is that the chime sound could be a tad louder. But overall, it's an impressive piece of tech that has added a layer of security to my home. A definite 5-star from me!"

    "reviewText": "I've been using this Smart Home Hub for about a month now and it's become a game-changer in my home. It seamlessly integrates with all my smart devices - from the lights to the thermostat - providing a one-stop control center. I love how I can manage everything from my smartphone! However, setup was a bit tricky and took some time, which was a bit off-putting. Also, the price tag is slightly steep for my liking. Nonetheless, it's an investment that's streamlined my daily routines. Despite the initial hiccup and price, I'd still highly recommend it for anyone looking to simplify their smart home setup."

    "reviewText": "The Smart Home Hub has some great features. I love that it's compatible with a wide range of devices and the voice control is super convenient when my hands are full. The design is sleek and compact, fitting seamlessly into my decor. However, I've had several issues with the connectivity. It often disconnects from my Wi-Fi, which is incredibly frustrating when I'm trying to control my devices. Additionally, the app could be more user-friendly. It's not very intuitive and I've had to spend a lot of time figuring it out. At $99.99, I expected a smoother experience. It's not a bad product by any means, but it does have room for improvement."

It's straightforward to set up, and connects perfectly with all my smart devices - from my thermostat to my smart bulbs. The user interface is user-friendly, even for a non-techie like me. The voice control feature is a blessing, especially when my hands are full (which is often with two toddlers!). There can be occasional connectivity issues, but they are quickly resolved most of the time. All in all, the Smart Home Hub has made my life so much easier, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to automate their home."

    "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this Smart Home Hub, but it left me pretty disappointed. The setup was fairly simple, and at first, it seemed to connect well with my other devices. However, the connection has been inconsistent, causing me to reset it numerous times. The voice recognition is spotty at best, which is frustrating when trying to control my smart lights and thermostat. I did appreciate the sleek design and it fits well with my home decor which is a small bonus. But considering it's a device meant to simplify my life, it's been more of a headache than a help. At this price point, I expected much better performance and reliability. Regrettably, I can't recommend this Smart Home Hub."

    "reviewText": "I recently picked up this Smart Home Hub and boy, has it made a difference in streamlining my home automation! It's been a breeze to connect with all my smart devices - from lights to thermostat to my security cameras. The interface is user-friendly and intuitive, even for a non-tech savvy person like me. I've also been impressed with the response speed, no annoying lags whatsoever. However, I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the setup instructions were a bit complex and took me a few tries to get everything working. Also, it doesn't support all brands of smart devices, specifically some of my older ones. But for the price of $99.99, it's a solid investment for anyone looking to make their home smarter."
